                    <span class="pink-text">Nadia is a seemingly cheery and laid-back individual, with a penchant for
                        taking
                        in the sights while traveling and napping. However, the aforementioned belies an extremely

                        analytical individual.</span>

                        can be cold, standoffish and prone to pessimism, but will use any means to assure the safety of
                        his

                <p class="description">When first met, Renne appeared to be a typical girl; mischievous, cheeky, and
                    having lots of fun. She did have a darker side however, initially lashing out against people that
                    tried to help her or refused to comply with her requests. This was a result of the traumatic
                    childhood she had, which resulted in a "self-defense" mechanism of sorts.</p>

                <p class="description">Roselia is secretive and cryptic by nature and often withholds information. She
                    has a slight mischievous streak and irresponsible nature, and can get into clashes of personality
                    with other opinionated individuals. Nevertheless, she has a long history of
                    wise council and helping to guide others.</p>

                <p class="description">Rufus Albarea is the head of the Albarea family, one of the Four Great Houses.
                    True to the word noble in both maturity and proper social standing, Rufus is kind and intelligent,
                    and well-mannered, and is able to conduct pleasant conversations with those of high-class society.
                    His respectful attitude towards both nobles and commoners makes him popular in the public eye. </p>

                <p class="description">Lapis is notably curious about the outside world and humans in general. She
                    believes that humans should simply lead the lives they want as they are all unique, most notably
                    being able to connect with Rufus Albarea during her travels with him. Despite being a doll, she
                    enjoys eating food</p>
